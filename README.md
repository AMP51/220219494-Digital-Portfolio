### Reflection
As part of my work readiness modules I was required to reflect on what is a career and how to go about choosing one.
After completing this module I took time to consider what I am looking for in a career in terms of goals and aspects relating to the job. I identified that distance, transportation and the abilitiy to grow my talents are important when choosing a career.
At the end of the module, I have gained a better understanding of what a career is and how to plan my career journey to align with my goals.

### Reflection
A part of my work readiness preperation modules we had to identify the purpose of our values, vocational interests and our skills in our job search. 
I aimed to identify my values, interests and my skills that could be applied to jobs. Firstly, in order to identify my values to understand what makes me fulfilled and what drives my decisions, then I identify professional interests to work in a career that increases my satisfaction in the position and finally I identify skills in order to have more engagement with the work I do and increase my confidence in my capabilities. 
This has made me more concious and analytical of my career choices, choosing ones that align with my skills, values and interests.
