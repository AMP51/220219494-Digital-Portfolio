### Reflection
As part of my work readiness modules I was required to reflect on what is a career and how to go about choosing one. After completing this module I took time to consider what I am looking for in a career in terms of goals and aspects relating to the job. I identified that distance, transportation and the abilitiy to grow my talents are important when choosing a career. At the end of the module, I have gained a better understanding of what a career is and how to plan my career journey to align with my goals.
